## [Unreleased]

BIDIR-6: the input half of a call.

### Breaking

| Change | Before | After | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CallCeiling` (plexus-auth-core) | `max_items` 1,000,000, `max_bytes` 64 MiB by default | no lifetime limit by default; `max_buffered` added, 64 MiB | Set the two only for a method that wants them; use `..Default::default()` in a struct literal |
| `duplex_gate::InputFrame` | one item | generic over what it holds, with `items` and `overrun` | `InputFrame::new` is unchanged; a struct literal names the new fields |
| `DuplexRefusal` | seven variants | adds `OutOfSequence`, `InvalidInput` | Add them to an exhaustive match |
| `DuplexRefusal::to_item` | `error_kind`, facts, `message` | a typed error item (spec/05): `metadata` and `code` too | Nothing, for a reader of those keys |
| `{ns}.input`, `{ns}.end` | `-32601` | methods of every service | Answer with `not_this_call` naming no call of the socket |

### Added

- `plexus::Input<T>` and `plexus::input`: a method's input half. The socket's
  `InputTable` takes `{ns}.input` and `{ns}.end` on its reader, the pipe drives
  `DuplexCall::input` beside the method's stream, and `credit` and `ack` move
  as the handler consumes.
- `DuplexGate::admitted` (a call its dispatch decided), `DuplexGate::ungated`,
  `DuplexCall::credit_line`.
- `MethodSchema.input` filled.

### Not enforced

- An input half is not forwarded across a hop: a method with `input` on a
  `RemoteChild` is refused, naming it.
- A frame of another connection finds no call and is not audited: the table is
  the connection's, so `not_this_call` is said to a request and a notification
  is counted (`InputTable::strays`).

## [0.7.0]

Upgrading from 0.6.1, the last published version. 0.6.2 below was never
published, so its changes reach crates.io here.

### Breaking

| Change | Before | After | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PlexusStreamItem::Data.content` | `Value` | `Content` | Read it with `into_value`; `PlexusStreamItem::data` still takes a `Value` |
| `PlexusStreamItem::Data.metadata` | `StreamMetadata` | `Arc<StreamMetadata>` | Wrap the value in a struct literal; reads go through the `Arc` |
| `PlexusStreamItem::Error` | no `fields` | `fields: serde_json::Map<String, Value>` | Name `fields` in a struct literal, or use `..`; empty serializes as before |
| A response to a bound question | any caller could answer | `BidirError::NotThisCall` from another connection | Add the variant to an exhaustive match; answer from the connection that was asked |
| A key no parameter claims, under `typed_params` | ignored | `-32602` invalid params | Send only declared keys; the echo activation now refuses them too |

### Added

- `plexus::duplex_gate`, the gate over a duplex call, and `answer_by` in
  method schemas.

### Not enforced

- `answer_by` is declared and carried in the schema, but no dispatch path
  checks it. `DuplexGate` is a library: a service must call `DuplexCall::answer`
  itself. A method that declares `answer_by` is not protected by the
  declaration alone.

## [0.6.2] — POLYGLOT-5: the child seam opened

### Added

- `plexus::RemoteChild` — an `Activation + ChildRouter + Clone` whose other end
  is a process on stdio or a service on a WebSocket speaking plexus-wire
  (spec/12, the hop between services): `RemoteChild::connect(ChildSpec,
  ChildOptions)`, `stats() -> ChildStats { open, unasked, restarts, calls }`,
  `pid()`, `principal()`, `mount_timings()`. Registered like any activation:
  its schema and roles merged under the mount name. An item for a call the
  child was not given is dropped, logged and counted `unasked`; one landing
  within 250 ms of an unsubscribe's `true` (spec/04's item in flight) is the
  cancel's tail, dropped quietly.
- `ChildSpec` (`NAME=stdio:CMD` | `NAME=ws://…`), `ChildOptions`, `Backoff`,
  `ChildError`, `ChildMethods`, `parse_duration`; `ChildArgs` behind the new
  `clap` feature (`--child`, `--child-timeout`, `--child-max-calls`,
  `--child-env`, `--child-key`).
- Features `child-ws` (default: a WebSocket child, dialed with the service's
  key proof) and `child-wss` (TLS).
- `PlexusStreamItem::Error { fields }` — the typed error's own fields
  (`error_kind`, `grant`, `scope`, `roles`, `held_on`, …), flattened on the
  wire; empty serializes as before. `PlexusStreamItem::typed_error`,
  `PlexusStreamItem::error_kind`. **A struct literal of `Error` now names
  `fields`** (`fields: Default::default()`), or uses `PlexusStreamItem::error`.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `DynamicHub::new()` now requires explicit namespace parameter
  - Forces intentional naming instead of defaulting to "plexus"
  - Example: `DynamicHub::new("substrate")` or `DynamicHub::new("myapp")`
  - Rationale: DynamicHub is a composition tool - its namespace should reflect your application

- **DEPRECATION**: `Plexus` type renamed to `DynamicHub` to clarify architecture
  - `Plexus` remains as a deprecated type alias for backwards compatibility
  - Will be removed in a future major version
  - Rationale: "Plexus" implied special infrastructure, when it's actually just an `Activation` with dynamic registration
  - See architecture documentation for migration guide

### Migration Guide

Replace `Plexus::new()` with `DynamicHub::new(namespace)`:

```rust
// Before
use hub_core::plexus::Plexus;
let hub = Plexus::new().register(activation);

// After
use hub_core::plexus::DynamicHub;
let hub = DynamicHub::new("myapp").register(activation);
```

Choose a namespace that identifies your application:
- "substrate" for substrate server
- "hub" for generic hubs
- "myapp" for your application name

The `Plexus` type alias will continue to work but will show deprecation warnings.
The old `with_namespace()` method is deprecated in favor of `new(namespace)`.
